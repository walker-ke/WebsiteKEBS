In a very small organization, there may be no &quot;system&quot;, just &quot;our way of doing things&quot;, and &quot;our way&quot; is probably not written down, but all in the head of the manager or owner.</p>          </td>

These help ensure that everyone is not just &quot;doing his or her  own thing&quot;, and that the organization goes about its business in an  orderly and structured way.

          <p align="justify"><strong>An EMS</strong> can identify instances of redundancy in day-to-day efforts for regulatory compliance. These can be eliminated, thus making the organization more efficient.</p>
