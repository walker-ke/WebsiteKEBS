    <p>Companies today, regardless of size, face ever increasing demands for profitability, quality, and technology that contributes to sustainable development. As a manager looking to turn these pressures into a competitive advantage, you need to develop an efficient management system tailored to your business processes and use it systematically to maintain and constantly improve your company's overall performance.
    </p>
    <p>How do companies manage the multitude of challenges they are facing?  They develop processes and performance standards to measure and meet  these challenges; they integrate business principles in management  systems.</p>
<p>Some companies take a holistic approach, bringing  quality, environment, health and safety issues together in a single  system. However, many companies do not extract the full value from  their management systems because they are generally perceived as a tool  to maintain status quo rather than a means to manage change and  improvement. Yet an effective management system must add value to the  business, essentially by doing things better, cheaper or faster as the  system matures and develops.</p>
<p>The main management system standards  emphasise continual improvement. Implementing a management system gives  you the opportunity to focus on optimising the areas that matter most  to you and your stakeholders.</p>
