It also means less duplication and makes it easier to adopt new systems  in the future.<br />
                      <br />
An integrated management system&nbsp;is aimed&nbsp;at organizations with a  single management system which incorporate two or more management system  standards (for example, <a href="#">ISO  9001 Quality Management</a> and <a href="#">ISO  14001 Environmental Management</a>).<br />
<br />
To successfully achieve integrated management systems certification, you will  need to demonstrate that you have one management system that encompasses all  existing management systems standards into one structure. <br />
