                      <p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary investigation</strong> <br />
                        When a client expresses interest in certification services, the KEBS CB  determines whether the client is sufficiently prepared for the audit  process. The client is requested to complete the Initial questionnaire <a href="pdfs/download.php?file=CER_F_02 Initial Questionnaire.pdf">(CER/FORM 2)</a><br />
                      If  the client is found not to be ready, the CB provides feedback on the gaps  identified.</p>
                      <p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application</strong><br />
                        If the client is found to be ready, a cost quotation is done and if  this is acceptable to the client, the client completes the formal  application form 
                       <a href="pdfs/download.php?file=CER_F_01 Application form.pdf">(CER/FORM  1)</a></p>
                      <p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage one audit</strong><br />
                        Certification audits are done in two stages; stage one and  two.</p>
                      <p>This  stage one audit is done to:</p>
                      <ul type="disc">
                          <li>review the clients documentation, </li>
                        <li>evaluate  if the client&rsquo;s internal audit and management reviews are being planned  and performed and if they are effective</li>
                        <li>provide focus for the stage 2 audit and       agree with the client on the details for the stage two audit</li>
                        <li>To confirm       information given in CER/FORM       2 and collect information regarding the scope of the audit</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>For  the initial certification audit, part of the stage one audit must be at the  client&rsquo;s premises.<br />
                        The time period between the stage one and the stage two audit is  dependent on the gaps identified during the stage one audit and is  mutually agreed between the CB and the client </p>
                      <p><strong>Stage 4: stage  two audit</strong><br />
                        The stage two audit is done on site and its main objective is to  evaluate the implementation well as the effectiveness of the client&rsquo;s  management system. During this audit non-conformities may be raised.  The client has 30 days in which to carry out corrective action on the  non-conformities raised.</p>
                      <p><strong>Stage 5: Certification  decision</strong><br />
                        After the follow-up audit, during which time the corrective action from  the stage two audit are confirmed to have been carried out, the audit  findings and conclusions are evaluated in order to make the  certification decision by the certification committee. </p>
                      <p>Once certified, the certificate is valid for 3 years</p>
                      <p><strong>Stage 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveillance</strong><br />
                        For the first contract period, surveillance audits are carried out  every six months. For subsequent contracts the frequency may be reduced  depending on the status of the management system. In any case the  frequency shall not be less than one a year.</p>
                      <p><strong>Stage 7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recertification</strong><br />
                        This  is virtually identical to the initial audit except that the stage one audit  does not have to be on site</p></td>
