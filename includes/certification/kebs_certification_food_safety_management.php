        <p align="justify"><strong>FSMS FOR SAFE FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS&nbsp;</strong><br />
          Food Safety is related to the presence of food borne hazards  in food at the point of consumption. Food reaches to consumers via supply  chains that may link many different types of organizations.&nbsp; One weak link  can result in unsafe food that is dangerous to health.&nbsp; As food safety  hazards can occur the food chain at any stage, adequate control throughout the  supply chain is essential. Therefore food safety is a joint responsibility of  all organizations with in the food chain including, producers, manufactures,  transport &amp; storage operators, sub contractors, retail and food service  outlets and service providers.<br />
          &nbsp; Recent studies have shown that there is significant  increase of illness caused by infected food in both developed and developing  countries which give rise to considerable economic costs besides being health  hazards.&nbsp; This has necessitated the need for establishing a food safety  management system by all types of organizations within the food chain.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>HIGHLIGHTS OF IS/ISO 22000:2005</strong><br />
        a) Integrates the principles of Hazards Analysis and  Critical Control Point (HACCP) system developed be Codex Alimentarius  Commission. It combines the HACCP plan with prerequisite programme (PRPs) and  operational PRPs.<br />
        b)&nbsp; Requires that all Hazards that may be reasonably  expected to occur in the food chain are identified, assessed and controlled.<br />
        c)&nbsp; Can be applied independent of other management  system standards or can be integrated with existing other management systems.<br />
        d)&nbsp;Allows even small, tiny scale organizations to  implement as externally developed combination of control measures.<br />
        e)&nbsp;&nbsp; Intended for organizations seeking more  focussed, coherent and integrated food safety management systems.<br />
        f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis on preventions of food safety hazards  of all types.&nbsp; <br />
        g) Ensures compliance with legislative and regulatory  requirements.<br />
        h)&nbsp;&nbsp;Provides for management of potential emergency  situations &amp; accidents that can impact food safety.<br />
