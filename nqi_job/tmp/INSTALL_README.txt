EXTENSION
=============
IMPORTANT: Like for most major extensions, your php installation must allow file uploads higher than the 2MB limit.

For the main BreezingForms component, you need at least a 4MB upload limit.
Please check your hosting or php.ini settings, or ask your hosting company to raise this limit if it is too low and you're not allowed to adjust it yourself. You can also use Joomla!'s alternative installation method to bypass such limits.

Please install the main component and addons if required (module, content plugins, google drive spreadsheets [gdata], etc) in the Joomla! Extension Manager. Enable the plugins manually if you need them.

GOOGLE DRIVE SPREADSHEETS
=============
In order to enable spreadsheets support in Google Drive, please install and enable the gdata plugin in the "addons" folder.

TELEGRAM
=============
In order to enable Telegram support, please install and enable the telegram plugin in the "addons" folder.

SKYPE
=============
In order to enable Skype Bot support, please install and enable the Skype plugin in the "addons" folder.

SAMPLE FORMS
=============
If you would like to install the sample forms, then please go to 

BreezingForms => Configuration => Package Installer

and upload one of the XML files. Each XML file contains multiple forms that you can use to start right away.

THEMES
=============

Please note the additional-themes folder in the main download package. 

Themes can be selected in form => advanced tab and need to be installed first as described below:

BOOTSTRAP4 THEMES
=============
To install themes for the quickmode for the use of bootstrap4, simply login to your site using your FTP client
and upload each desired folder to /media/breezingforms/themes-bootstrap4/

NATIVE BREEZINGFORMS THEMES (work anywhere)
=============
To install themes for the quickmode, simply login to your site using your FTP client
and upload each desired folder to /media/breezingforms/themes/

The theme(s) will then be accessible in the QuickMode editor.

Themes for different theming modes are not interchangeable. Native themes won't work with bootstrap themes and vice versa.
