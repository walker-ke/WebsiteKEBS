Use the Joomla automatic updater to receive update notifications.

For a manual update,  just install the component, without previous uninstall, otherwise your existing BreezingForms menu items will get lost.

For the main BreezingForms component, you need at least a 4MB upload limit.
Please check your php.ini settings or ask your hosting company to raise this limit if it is too low.
